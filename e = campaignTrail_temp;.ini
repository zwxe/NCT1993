Kenya Fujimori, leader of the National Reform Party, was officially appointed as the Prime Minister of the Cabinet by the Emperor. The whole world is paying attention to the election of the new prime minister. <br><br>Ken Fujimori is also a typical grassroots politician. He was born in a peasant family. He engaged in agricultural research in his early years and later became the host of a forum program. In the mid-1980s, Fujimori followed the wave of popular dissatisfaction with the establishment and established the National Reform Party. The party initially focused on rural areas and relied on its agricultural knowledge to follow the path of peasant populism. It began to move to cities in the late 1980s, gradually attracting more students and supporters from the middle and urban classes.<br><br> With his unique charm and new economic reform plan, Fujimori has successfully made many people at the bottom have a strong interest in him and the National Reform Party he leads, and has won the cooperation of economic liberals, cultural conservatives and other establishment groups. <br><br>Chinese President Hu Qili congratulated Fujimori on his election. He hopes that Fujimori will carry out Asia-Pacific economic cooperation and promote the development of democratic forces in Asia during his term.</div>","image_url":"https://telegra.ph/file/3089d7e744cd5aa14bbda.jpg","winning_electoral_vote_number":270,"advisor_url":"https://telegra.ph/file/5b0e73b6562caf0ee348d.jpg","recommended_reading":"<ul>\n<li><a href=https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-chicago-tribune-biden-endorsement-20200925-lnyxsb5qvrftnjjmj3rnzj33jy-story.html>Our Case For Joe Biden</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/case-trump-166808>The Case For Trump</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.npr.org/2020/11/18/935730100/how-biden-won-ramping-up-the-base-and-expanding-margins-in-the-suburbs>How Biden Won: Ramping Up The Base And Expanding Margins In The Suburbs</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/donald-trump-joe-biden-us-election-almost-win-votes-concede>Why Did Trump Almost Win?</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.hoover.org/research/no-evidence-voter-fraud-guide-statistical-claims-about-2020-election>No Evidence For Voter Fraud: A Guide To Statistical Claims About The 2020 Election</a></li>\n</ul>","has_visits":0,"no_electoral_majority_image":"../static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg"}}];e.temp_election_list = [{"id":15,"year":1988,"is_premium":0,"display_year":"1990"}];e.credits = "Flying Dutch";e.global_parameter_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.global_parameter","pk":1,"fields":{"vote_variable":1.125,"max_swing":0.12,"start_point":0.94,"candidate_issue_weight":10,"running_mate_issue_weight":3,"issue_stance_1_max":-0.71,"issue_stance_2_max":-0.3,"issue_stance_3_max":-0.125,"issue_stance_4_max":0.125,"issue_stance_5_max":0.3,"issue_stance_6_max":0.71,"global_variance":0.01,"state_variance":0.005,"question_count":25,"default_map_color_hex":"#C9C9C9","no_state_map_color_hex":"#999999"}}];e.candidate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":1001,"fields":{"first_name":"藤森","last_name":"謙也","election":15,"party":"National Reform Party—Cambio 90","state":"熊本県","priority":1,"description":"実際、私たちが行っていることは、民主主義を回復し、改善し、維持するこでとす—藤森 謙也","color_hex":"#ff7300","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://telegra.ph/file/dd82eba0556a53b886ba3.jpg","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>REAL PATRIOT DUMMY EXAMPLE SWEEPS</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>DUMMY EXAMPLE RETURNS TO HELL</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":false}}];e.running_mate_json = [];
